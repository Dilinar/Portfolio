# The Box-Sizer

When my little yarn shop grew, more orders came in. Not excluding wholesale orders. 


This brought a new challenge with it. Mainly: how do I get a large quantity of skeins abroad using the services of the Polish post? 

The main issue was getting it all to fit in a box, that did not exceed the limitations set by them. The max length can not exceed 150 cm and the circumference measured perpendicular to the length could not exceed 300 cm. So every time I needed to change one dimension, I've had to recalculate the rest. This was kind of problematic, and I could have used an app for that, so I wrote one. 

The Box-Sizer is not perfect, you can set the width or height to exceed the length, which would de facto make it the new length, but it serves its purpose.

Hope you like it ;)
