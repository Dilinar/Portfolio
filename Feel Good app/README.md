# Feel Good app
Having a rough day? Could use some kind words to lift Your spirit? And there is a lock down in effect so You can't go out to meet Your friends? 

The Feel Good app is exactly for days like that. Not only for those who like to look back on some nice words from time to time. 

Save any and all things anyone has said about You, including the author and place. All You need to do then is hit the "Draw Quote" button to display a randomly selected quote to remind You of a pleasant moment from the past.
